Introduction

    You will be creating a Hangman Game.

    Building it with Constructor functions.

    It will be a command line node app that will take in prompted text as an input.

    We will build this game step by setup one piece at a time.

Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.
Part 0: Setup

    Install the npm package prompt

npm install prompt --save

Part 1: Making the letter Constructor

    create a file called

letter.js

    Start by creating a constructor function named Letter
        it should take an argument let
        create a property called charac which will store the argument let
        create a property called appear set it to false
        create a function inside of the Letter constructor called letterRender
        when the function letterRender is called
            it will check the value of appear if false return a string "_", else it will return the value charac

export the Letter constuctor function with

module.exports = Letter;
Part 2: Making the Word Constructor

    create a file called

word.js

    Start by importing the letter.js file by using require, set it to a variable called Letter

    Create a constructor function named Word
        it should take an argument wrd
        create a property called word which will store the argument wrd
        create a property called lets which is set to an empty array
        create a property called found which is set to false

    create a function inside of Word constructor called getLets
        it will run a loop that iterate over each of the letter in the word property
        everytime the loop iterates, it creates a new Letter object with the argument being the current letter

    Hint: this function will create Letter objects that will be put into the lets array After this function runs, the property lets will contain Letter objects for each of the letter in word

    create a function inside of Word constructor called checkIfLetterFound
        this function will take an argument guessLetter
        create an varaible called whatToReturn and set it to the number 0
        it will run a loop that iterate over each object in the lets array
        check the current object that's being iterated over
        if the charac property in that object is equal to guessLetter, set the appear property of that object to true
        add 1 to checkIfLetterFound
        return checkIfLetterFound

    Hint: the objects in lets array are created with the Letter constructor, with all the property created in Letter constructor

    create a function inside of Word constuctor called didWeFindTheWord
        call the .every() method on the lets array
        .every() method takes in an anonymous function as argument, that function will take an argument curLet
        set the property found to true if all letter objects have the true value in their appear property
        return found

    Hint: look up .every to see how it works on array. the goal here is to have the didWeFindThWord function check if all the objects in lets array has appear property of true, if so then the function return true

    create a function inside of Word constuctor called wordRender
        create a varaible called str set it to "" empty string
        it will run a loop that iterate over each object in let array
        everytime the loop iterates, calling the letterRender on that object and then string concatenate that to the varaible str
        return str

export the Word constuctor function with

module.exports = Word;
Part 3: Making the Game

    create a file called

main.js

    Start by importing npm prompt by using require, set it to a variable called prompt
        call the .start() method on prompt

    Importing the word.js file by using require, set it to a variable called Word

    Create an object called game
        create a key named wordBank with the value of: an array contain strings, these are the works that the user will try to guess
        create a key named guessesRemaining with the value of: 10
        create a key named currentWrd with the value of: null
        create a function named startGame with an argument of wrd
            create a new Word object with an argument of a string from your wordBank, a random word
            set the newly created Word object to currentWrd
            called .getLets() method on the currentWrd object
            call the keepPropmtingUser() function with no argument, we haven't build keepPropmtingUser yet but will shortly

    Hint: currentWrd is now an object created with Word constructor it have all the function created in Word constructor

        create a function named keepPropmtingUser with no argument
            create a variable named self set it to this

            Hint: because when we are going inside the prompt object out this will lose scope, we must store this inside of self

            called the prompt.get() function with two arguments

            Hint: look up how npm prompt works

            first argument is an array with one element, a string named guessLetter
            second argument is an anonymous function

            the anonymous function has two arguments as well (err, result), the anonymous function will
                console logs ("The Letter or space you guessed is " + result.guessLetter)
                create a variable named findHowManyOfUserGuess, set it to currentWrd.checkIfLetterFound(result.guessLetter)

                *Hint: this checks if the letter was found and if so, sets that specific letter object to appear, it also returns a number

                check if findHowManyOfUserGuess is 0
                    if is 0, console log ("You gusses wrong~!")
                    minus 1 from the value guessesRemaining

                else
                    console log ('You guessed right!')
                    check if user has won the game
                    if function currentWrd.didWeFindTheWord() returns true
                        console log ('You Won!!!')
                        return 1 to end the game

                console log('Guesses remaining: ' + value of guessesRemaining);
                console log( call the wordRender() method on currentWrd )

                *Hint: this will display all the letters guessed, if correct display as letters and "_" has hidden letters not yet guessed correctly"

                if the value guessesRemaining is greater than 0 and the property currentWrd.found is false
                    called the function keepPromptingUser()
                    Hint: Yes we calling a function inside of itself the if statment stops the recursion from going infinite
                else if the value guessesRemaining is equal to 0
                    console log "Game over bro" and the word user was guessing
                else
                    console log (call the function .wordRender() on currentWrd)

    start the game by calling game.startGame()
